    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a sixteen-year-old software developer based in Lincoln, Nebraska.
        I've been programming since the age of nine and since then it has been my primary passion throughout life.
        Pursuing software development as a career has always been something I have wanted to do.
        I'm skilled and very comfortable with languages such as Python and JavaScript, but learning new languages and technologies has been always been something I enjoy doing to a great degree.
        I have a hunger to push myself and learn as much as I possibly can.
        I am very good at researching problems I encounter and can normally fix them very quickly, I would consider this one of my biggest strengths.
        Learning and programming are two things I'm extremely passionate about in my life, and I'm always very happy at the opportunity to work on a new project.
