    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a sixteen-year-old software developer based in Lincoln, Nebraska.
        I've been programming since the age of nine and since then it has been my primary passion throughout life.
        Pursuing software development has been a career I've always wanted to pursue.
        I'm skilled and very comfortable with languages such as Python and JavaScript, but learning new languages and technologies has been always been something I enjoy doing to a great degree.
        I have a hunger to push myself and learn as much as I possibly can. I am also really good at googling resources to learn from, I would consider this one of my strongest skills.
        Learning and programming are two things I'm extremely passionate about in life, and I'm always very happy at the opportunity to work on a new project.
